## 2. Business Goal
Module này kiểm soát việc gọi AI để tạo lịch trình đúng quota, idempotent và không trừ quota khi AI lỗi trước kết quả hợp lệ.

## 3. Module Scope

### In Scope
- Guest tạo lịch trình AI đầu tiên một lần.
- Member tạo lịch trình mới theo quota/gói.
- Lưu Personal Plan và Plan Item.
- Retry an toàn khi AI thất bại.

### Out of Scope
- Raw prompt/response AI trong DD.
- Chẩn đoán y tế.
- Rate limit kỹ thuật chi tiết ngoài BD.

## 4. Roles and Permissions

| Role | Permissions in This Module | Limitations |
|---|---|---|
| Guest, Member | Use module features according to BD sections 3, 5, and BD sections 6/M02, 13, 16.1 AC-01/AC-02/AC-05/AC-06, Appendix A UC-02/UC-08. | Must not bypass entitlement, ownership, family consent, Sale/Admin scope, or audit rules. |
| System | Validate state, apply business rules, write events/audit where required. | Must be idempotent and must follow accepted product decisions. |
| Admin/Super Admin | Operate only where BD grants admin responsibility. | Backend/API must reject missing permission; UI hiding is not sufficient. |

## 5. Primary Entities/Data

| Entity ID | Entity | Purpose | Important Attributes | Relationships |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI-E-personal_plan | Personal Plan | Lịch trình AI | owner, subject, version, status, AI source | Has Plan Items |
| PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI-E-plan_item | Plan Item | Bữa ăn/bài tập/mốc lịch | plan id, time, type, status | Used by dashboard and notification |
| PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI-E-ai_request | AI Request | Theo dõi request/quota | request_id, type, status, quota impact | Linked to quota ledger |

## 6. States and State Transitions

| Entity / Group | States | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Personal Plan | draft, generating, active, archived, failed | Source: BD Appendix B and module sections. |

## 7. Business Rules

| ID | Rule | Applied At | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|
| PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI-BR01 | Guest chỉ được tạo lịch trình AI đầu tiên một lần. | Schedule generation, quota use, retry | Mandatory |
| PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI-BR02 | Nếu AI thất bại trước kết quả hợp lệ, không trừ quota và retry phải idempotent. | Schedule generation, quota use, retry | Mandatory |

## 8. Overall Operational Flow

1. Actor enters the module through the planned view or event listed in Views.md.
2. System validates authentication, entitlement, role, ownership, family scope, Sale status, or Admin permission as applicable.
3. System loads only the data needed for AI Lịch trình cá nhân.
4. Feature function applies module business rules and cross-cutting rules from BD sections 14 and 15.
5. Successful writes use transaction/idempotency and audit where required.
6. UI/API returns a safe business result and never exposes raw stack trace, DB/API wording, secret, payment evidence, or unnecessary health data.

## 9. Integrations and Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Purpose | Failure Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auth/Profile | Internal/Supabase planned | Identify actor and ownership. | Block action or request login. |
| Membership/Entitlement | Internal/trusted backend planned | Apply Free/Plus/FamilyPlus access and quotas. | Keep previous state; do not grant paid access. |
| Audit/Security | Cross-cutting | Trace sensitive changes. | Sensitive writes must fail or be queued safely if audit cannot be recorded. |
| Module-specific dependencies | Internal | ONBOARDING_PROFILE: input cá nhân hóa., MEMBERSHIP_QUOTA: kiểm tra quota/gói., SCHEDULE_NOTIFICATIONS: nhận lịch để tạo nhắc. | Follow dependency owner DD and record conflict as an implementation issue or accepted exception. |

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Security | Enforce UI, route, use-case/API, and database/RLS layers for sensitive data and paid/Sale/Admin access. |
| Data Integrity | Use unique business keys/idempotency for writes, especially payment, quota, point, family, notification, and admin actions. |
| Privacy | Minimize health, family, payment, and referral data exposure by role. |
| Observability | Log safe module status, correlation id, actor type, and audit-relevant changes only. |
| Resilience | Dependency failures must not create duplicate rights, duplicate points, incorrect quota, or partial financial state. |

## 11. Risks, Assumptions, and Decisions

| ID | Type | Content | Impact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI-RISK01 | Implementation evidence backlog | Runtime/sandbox evidence, final wireframes, and production acceptance remain outside DD completeness. | Implementation must produce evidence before production release. | Tracked |
| PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI-ASSUMPTION01 | Assumption | BD v2.0 plus user decisions from 2026-06-30 are the source of truth; legacy conflicting Sale/Admin logic is not implementation source. | Implementation must migrate or reject old behavior such as Sale tree, tier-2 commission, or 5 percent rules. | Active |
| PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI-Q-16 | Answered decision | Which timezone is authoritative? | Use Vietnam timezone, Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh. | Accepted - User decision 2026-06-30 |

## 12. ADR Summary

| ID | Decision | Context | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI-ADR01 | Approve this module DD as docs-complete and track runtime/sandbox evidence separately. | The user requested DD docs 100 percent without changing runtime code or claiming sandbox evidence. | Accepted |
| PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI-ADR02 | Keep accepted product decisions as the module business contract. | Q-01..Q-18 are closed by user decision and recorded in the DD registry. | Accepted |

## 13. Traceability Matrix
