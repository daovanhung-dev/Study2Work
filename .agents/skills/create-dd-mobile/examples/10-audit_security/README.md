## Answered Questions
| ID | Question | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-12 | Which Admin groups exist? | All Admin groups exist: Super Admin, Finance Admin, Support Admin, and Content Admin. | Answered - User decision 2026-06-30 |
| Q-13 | Who can edit sensitive data and Sale points? | Admin has broad operational power, but only Super Admin can edit sensitive data, perform full-data edits, or make manual Sale point adjustments. Each action requires reason, idempotency, and audit. | Answered - User decision 2026-06-30 |
| Q-18 | What customer information may Sale see? | Sale may see customer phone number and basic profile information for customer care, but cannot see health data, AI data, secrets, or raw payment payloads. | Answered - User decision 2026-06-30 |

## Product Decisions Applied (2026-06-29)
- Q-12: Admin active has full audited operational CRUD capability through Admin RPC/backend, not direct Flutter writes to every Supabase table.
- Q-13: Manual Sale point adjustment is allowed and requires exactly one Admin approval with reason/idempotency/audit.
- Q-18: Customer visibility is limited to basic profile/contact/status summaries; health data, AI content, secrets, and raw payment payloads stay hidden.

- Runtime code, SQL, Supabase config, and tests were not changed in this DD docs 100 percent pass.
