## Answered Questions

|---|---|---|---|
| Q-02 | When is a referral counted as successful? | A referral is successful when the referred customer payment is manually approved. Points are credited immediately after approval, but conversion is locked for 24 hours. | Answered - User decision 2026-06-30 |
| Q-03 | What is the 10 percent commission base? | Commission is calculated from the listed package price. | Answered - User decision 2026-06-30 |
| Q-05 | How are refund, cancel, and chargeback handled after points are credited? | Refund/cancel is allowed only within 24 hours after purchase. Points are reversed immediately in that window.
