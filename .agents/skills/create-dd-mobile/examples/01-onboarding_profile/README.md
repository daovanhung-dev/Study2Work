## Traceability Summary
- ONBOARDING_PROFILE-F01: Thu thập dữ liệu onboarding, bao gồm Daily Routine Preferences.
- ONBOARDING_PROFILE-F02: Xác nhận hoàn tất onboarding.
- Delta 2026-08-17: Daily Routine dùng explicit/canonical subject ownership; storage recency không phải identity signal; load error không được coi là empty/default state.

## Dependent Modules
- PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI: dùng hồ sơ và Daily Routine để sinh lịch trình đầu tiên.
- AUTH_PROFILE_SYNC: đồng bộ Guest -> Member.
- FAMILYPLUS: subject_member_id khi onboarding cho thành viên gia đình.

## Answered Questions
| ID | Question | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-14 | Which health formulas are used? | Use reference wellness formulas only, not diagnosis: BMI by CDC, BMR/RMR by Mifflin-St Jeor, TDEE by activity factor, hydration by National Academies DRI, sleep/activity by CDC. M08 health score is versioned and separate from daily local score. | Answered - User decision 2026-06-30 |
| Q-15 | How does FamilyPlus member visibility work? | FamilyPlus has up to 5 members. Every joined member in the package can view all information of every other member in the package. | Answered - User decision 2026-06-30 |
| Q-21 | How is Daily Routine local ownership resolved? | Canonical subject resolver: authenticated/trusted subject, else durable pending guest; fail closed when unresolved; never use record recency. | Answered - implementation correction 2026-08-17 |
