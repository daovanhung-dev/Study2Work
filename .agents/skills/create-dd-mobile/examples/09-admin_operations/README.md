## Answered Questions
| ID | Question | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-12 | Which Admin groups exist? | All Admin groups exist: Super Admin, Finance Admin, Support Admin, and Content Admin. | Answered - User decision 2026-06-30 |
| Q-13 | Who can edit sensitive data and Sale points? | Admin has broad operational power, but only Super Admin can edit sensitive data, perform full-data edits, or make manual Sale point adjustments. Each action requires reason, idempotency, and audit. | Answered - User decision 2026-06-30 |
| Q-17 | Can webhook/trusted recorder approve payments automatically? | All payments and transfers are manually reviewed and manually approved by Admin. Trusted recorder may only create pending evidence; only Admin approval creates payment_approved. | Answered - User decision 2026-06-30 |
| Q-18 | What customer information may Sale see? | Sale may see customer phone number and basic profile information for customer care, but cannot see health data, AI data, secrets, or raw payment payloads. | Answered - User decision 2026-06-30 |

## Product Decisions Applied (2026-06-29)
- Q-12: Admin active has full audited operational CRUD capability through Admin RPC/backend, not direct Flutter writes to every Supabase table.
- Q-13: Manual Sale point adjustment is allowed and requires exactly one Admin approval with reason/idempotency/audit.
- Q-17: Payment approval is mandatory manual; trusted recorder only creates pending payment evidence for Admin review.
- Q-18: Admin/Sale may see customer name and basic profile/contact/status summaries; health data, AI content, secrets, and raw payment payloads stay hidden.

## Validation Notes
- DD docs complete: all product questions are answered and documented as implementation policy.
- Runtime, sandbox/RLS/API smoke, and production acceptance evidence are tracked in the Implementation Evidence Backlog, not as DD blockers.
- The original DD docs 100 percent pass did not change runtime code, SQL,
  Supabase config, or tests; later implementation updates are recorded below.

## Implementation Update — 2026-09-13

- Admin Web đã bổ sung hiển thị thời hạn subscription và form chỉnh hạn cho
  Super Admin; phạm vi không bao gồm Flutter Admin cũ, bulk provisioning hoặc
  payment provider/Google Play.
- SQL/RPC và Edge Function giữ service-role boundary, manual-only guard,
  `expected_ends_at`, row lock, trạng thái expired, audit và idempotency.
- Bằng chứng local gồm Admin Web test/typecheck/build, Deno handler test và
  static contract source. Supabase sandbox, deploy và browser-smoke vẫn là
  evidence backlog, chưa được suy diễn là production acceptance.
