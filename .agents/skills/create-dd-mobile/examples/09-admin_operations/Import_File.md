# Import File — ADMIN_OPS / Admin quản lý hệ thống

## 0. Dependency Rules

1. Presentation -> Provider/Controller -> Use case/Service -> Repository -> Datasource/API/DAO.
2. Presentation must not import SQLite DAO, Supabase raw client, or payment/referral backend directly.
3. Domain/use-case code must not import UI widgets or BuildContext.
4. Shared utilities must not contain module-specific business logic.
5. Secrets, service-role keys, payment evidence, and raw health data must not be hard-coded or committed.
