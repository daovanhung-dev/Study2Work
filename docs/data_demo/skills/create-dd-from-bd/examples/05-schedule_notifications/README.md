## Traceability Summary
- SCHEDULE_NOTIFICATIONS-F01: Lên lịch thông báo.
- SCHEDULE_NOTIFICATIONS-F02: Xử lý action từ thông báo.
- Delta 2026-08-17: “Để sau” = defer 30 phút, source vẫn pending, không cộng điểm; legacy `skipped` chỉ là compatibility input.
- Delta 2026-08-16: manual health task tái sử dụng scheduler hiện tại và hỗ trợ opt-out reminder theo item.
- Delta 2026-07-13: hành động mở nhiệm vụ không hoàn thành nền.

## Dependent Modules
- PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI: source plan items.
- DASHBOARD_SCHEDULE: source task state và completion flow.
- FAMILYPLUS: subject and privacy boundary.
