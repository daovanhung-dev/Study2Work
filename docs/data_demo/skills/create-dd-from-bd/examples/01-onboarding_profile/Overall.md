## 4. Roles and Permissions

| Role | Permissions in This Module | Limitations |
|---|---|---|
| Guest, Member | Use module features according to BD sections 3, 5, and BD sections 6/M01, 13, 16.1 AC-01, Appendix A UC-01. | Must not bypass entitlement, ownership, family consent, Sale/Admin scope, or audit rules. |
| System | Validate state, apply business rules, write events/audit where required. | Must be idempotent and must follow accepted product decisions. |
| Admin/Super Admin | Operate only where BD grants admin responsibility. | Backend/API must reject missing permission; UI hiding is not sufficient. |

## 5. Primary Entities/Data

| Entity ID | Entity | Purpose | Important Attributes | Relationships |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ONBOARDING_PROFILE-E-guest_profile | Guest Profile | Hồ sơ local trước đăng nhập | local key, first schedule flag, onboarding status | May sync to App User |
| ONBOARDING_PROFILE-E-onboarding_profile | Onboarding Profile | Dữ liệu cá nhân hóa | owner, subject, profile version, completion status | Used by Personal Plan and Health Calculator |

## 6. States and State Transitions

| Entity / Group | States | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Onboarding | not_started, in_progress, completed | Source: BD Appendix B and module sections. |

## 7. Business Rules

| ID | Rule | Applied At | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|
| ONBOARDING_PROFILE-BR01 | Onboarding phải có dữ liệu bắt buộc trước khi chuyển sang AI tạo lịch trình. | Onboarding steps, profile save, first schedule handoff | Mandatory |
| ONBOARDING_PROFILE-BR02 | FamilyPlus onboarding phải ghi đúng subject_member_id và không ghi đè hồ sơ người khác. | Onboarding steps, profile save, first schedule handoff | Mandatory |

## 8. Overall Operational Flow

1. Actor enters the module through the planned view or event listed in Views.md.
2. System validates authentication, entitlement, role, ownership, family scope, Sale status, or Admin permission as applicable.
3. System loads only the data needed for Onboarding & Hồ sơ sức khỏe.
4. Feature function applies module business rules and cross-cutting rules from BD sections 14 and 15.
5. Successful writes use transaction/idempotency and audit where required.
6. UI/API returns a safe business result and never exposes raw stack trace, DB/API wording, secret, payment evidence, or unnecessary health data.

## 9. Integrations and Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Purpose | Failure Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auth/Profile | Internal/Supabase planned | Identify actor and ownership. | Block action or request login. |
| Membership/Entitlement | Internal/trusted backend planned | Apply Free/Plus/FamilyPlus access and quotas. | Keep previous state; do not grant paid access. |
| Audit/Security | Cross-cutting | Trace sensitive changes. | Sensitive writes must fail or be queued safely if audit cannot be recorded. |
| Module-specific dependencies | Internal | PERSONAL_SCHEDULE_AI: dùng hồ sơ để sinh lịch trình đầu tiên., AUTH_PROFILE_SYNC: đồng bộ Guest -> Member., FAMILYPLUS: subject_member_id khi onboarding cho thành viên gia đình. | Follow dependency owner DD and record conflict as an implementation issue or accepted exception. |

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Security | Enforce UI, route, use-case/API, and database/RLS layers for sensitive data and paid/Sale/Admin access. |
| Data Integrity | Use unique business keys/idempotency for writes, especially payment, quota, point, family, notification, and admin actions. |
| Privacy | Minimize health, family, payment, and referral data exposure by role. |
| Observability | Log safe module status, correlation id, actor type, and audit-relevant changes only. |
| Resilience | Dependency failures must not create duplicate rights, duplicate points, incorrect quota, or partial financial state. |

## 11. Risks, Assumptions, and Decisions

| ID | Type | Content | Impact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ONBOARDING_PROFILE-RISK01 | Implementation evidence backlog | Runtime/sandbox evidence, final wireframes, and production acceptance remain outside DD completeness. | Implementation must produce evidence before production release. | Tracked |
| ONBOARDING_PROFILE-ASSUMPTION01 | Assumption | BD v2.0 plus user decisions from 2026-06-30 are the source of truth; legacy conflicting Sale/Admin logic is not implementation source. | Implementation must migrate or reject old behavior such as Sale tree, tier-2 commission, or 5 percent rules. | Active |
| ONBOARDING_PROFILE-Q-14 | Answered decision | Which health formulas are used? | Use reference wellness formulas only, not diagnosis: BMI by CDC, BMR/RMR by Mifflin-St Jeor, TDEE by activity factor, hydration by National Academies DRI, sleep/activity by CDC. M08 health score is versioned and separate from daily local score. | Accepted - User decision 2026-06-30 |
| ONBOARDING_PROFILE-Q-15 | Answered decision | How does FamilyPlus member visibility work? | FamilyPlus has up to 5 members. Every joined member in the package can view all information of every other member in the package. | Accepted - User decision 2026-06-30 |
